# Giphy-Party
Project for Springboard Software Engineering BootCamp Cohort Jan 2022. 

## Assignment
Create a simmple page to practice accessing an API. I accessed the GIPHY API using a input on my page, returning and posting a gif on the webpage. We were instructed to have a remove button that removes all of the gifs at once. I used jquery in some areas to gain more experience. 

## To Do
I could redirect the user to the giphy url if they selected a meme. I did not make the gif search return random results. The CSS needs much more work. Given the focus of the project, I did not spend much time on the actual styling and focused on the API access instead.
